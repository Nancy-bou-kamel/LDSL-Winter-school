I implemented a neural network for modal sense classification, adapting the convolutional neural network architecture proposed by Germies (2020). The model was trained, developed, and tested on a different dataset with uniform labels: dynamic (capability), epistemic (possibility), and deontic (permission or obligation). Using a convolutional neural network for this task, I employed categorical cross-entropy as the loss function to optimize the model's performance.
